## the metamaterials ambition at cartheur

Work on combining energy and materials as one-in-the-same

### Background

I realized in 2010 that wireless power circuits work better having materials specifically-designed to suit purpose. I even included this notion in a ESRPC grant application the same year, only to have it pigeonholded and mysteriously reappear in a new guise funding my advisors. Fraud? Piff, just business-as-usual at an Oxbridge University.

Luckily, we are self-funding this research.
